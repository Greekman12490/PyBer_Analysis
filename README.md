# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

### V. Isualize has given Omar and I a new assignment to complete. We were tasked to create a summary dataframe of data consisting of ride-sharing in city types. These city types consist of urban (core of a city), suburban (outskirts of a city) and rural (areas outside the bounds of a city). Once the dataframe has been created, we will utilize the graphing interface of Python (matplotlib) via Jupyter Notebook to graph the totals of each city types weekly fares.


## Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.


## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
